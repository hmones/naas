	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">The following Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand which personal and other data we collect and process when you visit our website <a href="https://www.naasnetwork.org/">naasnetwork.org</a>, and the rights you have under the Data Protection Law.
		<br>
		<br>The term “personal data” comprises all information that can be used to personally identify you. The specific data we collect and how we use them depends on the service we offer. With regard to the terms used, such as “personal data” or their “processing”, we refer to the definitions in accordance with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">Article 4</a> of the GDPR.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">To respond to changing laws and technologies, we might need to update and make changes to this policy from time to time. Please be sure to check this policy periodically to familiarize yourself with the latest version. Kindly note that by continuing to use our site, or on pages where the Privacy Policy is posted, you consent to the use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<h3 style="text-align: left;">1. Who is responsible for the collection, processing, and use of your data?</h3>

	</p>

	<h3 style="text-align: left;">2. General information regarding data processing and legal grounds</h3>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">This Data Policy governs all the pages of our website <a href="http://www.naasnetwork.org">www.naasnetwork.org</a> and informs you about which personal and other data is collected when visiting our website, and how the data is used and for which purpose.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">This Data Policy does not apply to pages hosted by other websites or related organizations or third party sites. The NAAS website may be linked to the websites of such other parties but those other sites may have their own data policy which applies to them.&nbsp;</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">This Data Policy applies only to information provided to the website and communications with us through the website. It does not apply to any other information or communications that may reference NAAS - Network of Arab Alternative Screens.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we are committed to treating it responsibly and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations as well as with this Data Policy.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Access to third-party links</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Our website may contain links to other third-party websites and services. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this Privacy policy. We urge our users to exercise caution and read the privacy policy applicable to these websites before using their services.</p>

	<h3 style="text-align: left;">3. Your rights with regard to personal data relating to your person</h3>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">On the basis of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact us at no cost if you have questions relating to the collection, processing or use of your personal information. You may do so by using the contact details provided at the top of this Data Policy.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">You have the following rights towards us regarding the personal data concerning you:</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Art. 15 GDPR - Right of information:&nbsp;You have the right to request information about the personal data we store about you at any time.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Art. 15 GDPR - Right of access:&nbsp;If you have an account on our Website’s Member Space, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Art. 16 GDPR - Right to Rectification and Restrict Access:&nbsp;In addition,you have the right to correct incorrect data, or, alternatively, in accordance with&nbsp;Art. 18 GDPR, to request a restriction on the processing of the data.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
		<br>Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR - Right to Withdraw Consent:&nbsp;You can also revoke consent, always with implications for the future.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Art. 17 GDPR - Right to be Forgotten:&nbsp;You have the right to delete any personal data we hold about you.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Art. 20 GDPR - Right to Data Portability:&nbsp;You have the right to receive a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
		<br>Please note that you have the right to have incorrect data corrected or to have personal data deleted, where such claim is not barred by any legal obligation to retain this data.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Art. 77 GDPR - Right to Appeal:&nbsp;Moreover, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervising authority if you are of the opinion that the processing of the data concerning you violates data protection provisions. The right of appeal can be asserted in particular with a supervisory authority in the member state of your residence, your place of work or the place of the presumed infringement.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">
		<br>
	</p>

	<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">B. Security of collected Data</h2>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We adopt organizational, contractual and technical security measures in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR to ensure an appropriate level of security and to protect the data which is processed by us against accidental or deliberate manipulation, loss, destruction, or against access by unauthorized persons.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Our security measures include strong connection standards such as AES-256 encryption to protect the transmission of personal data between your web browser and our servers. When encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http: //" to "https: //" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We would like to point out that data transmission on the internet (e.g when communicating with us via email) may have security gaps and cannot be fully ensured. Full protection against third parties access of data is therefore not possible.</p>

	<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">C. User data storage Location and duration</h2>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
		<br><strong>Where is your data stored?</strong></p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">All the data that we collect is stored in databases in third-party platforms: Google Drive, MailChimp and October CMS. For further information on these services’ privacy policies and terms of service, we provide links below:</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
		<br><strong>How long will your data be stored ?</strong></p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">The data processed by us will be deleted or restricted in their processing in accordance with Art. 17 and 18 GDPR. Unless expressly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their intended purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory retention requirements.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. The statutory deadlines are usually six or ten years. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">If, for any reason, you should be required to provide the personal data of third parties, you need to ensure in advance that you have the consent of the affected person(s) to provide this data to us.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">The user data shall be treated confidentially by us and stored on secure servers. Personal data, which you enter via forms on the Member Space, shall be processed by us in the form of emails. It is therefore stored on our email server.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">As part of the registration and repeated logins and the use of our online services, we store the IP address and the time of the respective user action.

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">According to legal requirements in Germany, the storage takes place in particular for 10 years according to §§ 147 Abs. 1 AO, 257 Abs. 1 Nr. 1 and 4, Abs. 4 HGB (books, records, management reports, accounting documents, trading books, more relevant for taxation Documents, etc.) and 6 years according to § 257 Paragraph 1 No. 2 and 3, Paragraph 4 HGB (commercial letters).</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Subscription to our Newsletter</strong></p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">In order to subscribe to our newsletter, we require your consent, which is the legal basis for processing your data according to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 (a) of the GDPR.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>a) Subscription Data:</strong></p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">In order to process your application for a newsletter subscription, we ask you to enter mandatory information such as your full name and email address, and other optional information such as name and location of the institution you are part of. We will process the data you provided to us only for the purpose of sending you the corresponding newsletter and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>b) Double Opt-in Procedure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Double opt-in and logging: The registration for our newsletter takes place, using a double opt-in procedure. This means that after registration you will receive an email in which you will be asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with someone else's email address.&nbsp;</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>c) Logging of Registration Process:</strong></p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">The registration for the newsletter is logged in order to be able to prove that the registration process took place in accordance with the legal requirements. This includes storing the time of registration and confirmation, as well as the IP address.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>d) Subscription Cancellation:</strong>
		<br>
		<br>You may withdraw your consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter or by sending us your request to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@naasnetwork.org">info@naasnetwork.org</a>. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members' area) remain unaffected.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Once you withdraw your consent, you will no longer receive our newsletter in the future.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>e) Mailchimp</strong></p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We rely on the services of Mailchimp to design, send and manage our newsletter to our subscribers. The data we collect when you register for the newsletter is sent to Mailchimp’s server operated by The Rocket Science Group LLC. The company is domiciled in the State of Georgia in the United States and contractually commits to transfer and process all of its users’ Swiss, EU, and UK data in compliance with the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">In the context of NAAS's newsletter, we use small files called "web beacons” that are only retrieved directly from Mailchimp’s server when the newsletter is opened and technical information (browser used, system, IP address, retrieval time) is retrieved. Based on this information, we are able to learn whether the newsletters are opened by users at all, when they are opened and which links are used by them.
		<br>
		<br>As per Mailchimp <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>,&nbsp;Section 5 (E), Mailchimp complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>

	<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Integration of YouTube and Vimeo Videos</h3>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Embedded YouTube videos</strong></p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Our website uses plugins from the YouTube website. The operator of the website is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We use YouTube in the extended data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the video. However, data transfer to YouTube partners is not necessarily excluded by the extended data protection mode. This is how YouTube connects to the Google DoubleClick network regardless of whether you are watching a video.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">As soon as you start a YouTube video on our website, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. The YouTube server is informed which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to assign your surfing behavior directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Furthermore, YouTube can save various cookies on your device after starting a video. With the help of these cookies, YouTube can receive information about visitors to our website. This information is used, among other things, to collect video statistics, improve user-friendliness and prevent attempted fraud. The cookies remain on your device until you delete them.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">If necessary, further data processing operations can be triggered after the start of a YouTube video, over which we have no influence.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">YouTube is used in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit.f GDPR.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">You can find more information about data protection at YouTube in their data protection declaration at: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.</p>

		<br>
		<br>When you visit a website with a Vimeo plug-in, a connection to the Vimeo server is established and the plug-in is displayed. Through this, the Vimeo server receives information on which of our websites you have visited. If you are logged in as a member of Vimeo, Vimeo links this information to your personal user account. When using the plug-in, for example by clicking the start button of a video, this information is also linked to your user account. You can prevent this information from being linked by signing out of your Vimeo user account before using our website and deleting the corresponding Vimeo cookies.
