<p style="text-align: left;">Since 2016, NAAS has engaged in sector-wide research programs aiming to provide organizational, programming and financial information on its member spaces,  as well as a better understanding of cinema-going experiences of audiences in the region today. In June 2016, NAAS launched <a href="http://malaffatnaas.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malaffat</a>, a research blog that consists of a platform for critical writing and discussion around cinema as a unique artistic and social institution.</p>
